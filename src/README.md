# WP Search With Algolia

Integrate the powerful Algolia search service with WordPress.

## Development Workflow

🏗**Install dependencies with NPM**

```bash
$ npm i
```
*This will install a couple of things like Webpack and the required libraries from Algolia*

-------------------

👀 **Watch for changes and compile for development**
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
*This uses Webpack's "watch" feature to automatically recompile on save. Note: this is not hot module reloading.*

-------------------

♻️ **Optimize for production**
```bash
$ npm run build
```
*Tell Webpack to compile and minify the bundle for your production environment*
